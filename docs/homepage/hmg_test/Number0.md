With rising temperatures in the world, and while people continue to pump out dirty emissions, our air becomes more and more polluted. According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/how-air-pollution-is-destroying-our-health): **Nine out of ten people breathe polluted air and pollution kills around 7 million people every year**. These pollutants have a much more serious affect on our health than we realise, as a matter of fact one third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease are due to air pollution. 

This is a huge problem for the entire world, but it would be an impossible assignment for us to take on. We are therefore only taking a look at a single city, New York. This project will explore air pollution in New York City and the health effects it's causing.

<!-- After careful considerations these five questions were the ones that we sought out to answer:

1.	How has pollution developed in New York in recent years?
2.	Are certain neighborhoods more polluted than others?
3.	Are the source of pollution different in some neighborhoods?
4.	Are more deaths, Asthma Emergency Department Visits, Cardiovascular Hospitalizations and Respiratory Hospitalizations in boroughs that have higher percent of poverty?
5.	Is it possible to predict the pollution in the future ? -->
