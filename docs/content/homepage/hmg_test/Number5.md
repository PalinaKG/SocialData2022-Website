What about the future? Now that we know that air pollution has been decreasing in the last years, could we expect it to keep going down?

Using the data we already have, we created a machine learning model to make predictions for the future. This way we can get an idea on what to expect in the next years! The plot below shows the results of that model.

{{< include-html "content/homepage/bokeh_plots/Predictions.html" "We created a machine learning model to predict the future amount of pollutants for the years 2019-2028." "When plotting the original data with the predicted data we can very well see that the data points are following a very slow logarithmic trend for each pollutant." "Looking at these final plots is reassuring that we are on the right track and hopefully, by continuing on this track, we can all breathe cleaner, healthier air in the near future!">}}
