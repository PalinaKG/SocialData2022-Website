But how has New York air pollution been evolving through the years? Is everything still going downhill or could we be on the right track?

To find out, let's investigate the different air pollutants, averaged over the entire city. We can also investigate whether there is some difference in air pollution between seasons by looking at summer, winter, and annual values individually!

{{< include-html "content/homepage/bokeh_plots/pollutants.html" "Looking through the plots we can see pretty much consistent downward trends for all pollutants. We are clearly improving our quality of air a lot but we still have a long way to go!" "We can also see that the amount of pollution in the air is consideribly higher in the winter then the summer for most instances, which is quite interesting.  ">}}
