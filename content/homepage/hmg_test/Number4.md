What about the effects this air pollution is having on people's health? Could your financial status or the race you are born into play a factor in the impact air pollution has on you?

Scientists believe that it does matter. People living in poverty and those of Black or Hispanic descent are more likely to be impacted by air pollution. To investigate this, we will look at four separate aspects of the impacts of air pollution: death, asthma emergency department visits, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and respiratory hospitalizations. Can we see any links between poverty, race, and these health risks when looking at data from the New York City boroughs?

{{< include-html "content/homepage/bokeh_plots/health.html" "It is quite shocking to see how many deaths are linked to PM2.5 particles each year. Although Brooklyn has the highest number of deaths, it doesn't have the highest ratio compared to population. The Bronx has the highest ratio of deaths, Asthma ER visits, Cardiovascular Hospitalizations and Respiratory Hospitalizations from 2005-2011. Bronx has also the highest percentage of people living in poverty, the lowest median income and the highest percentage of Black and Hispanic people." >}}

Take a look at the graphs here below to see the poverty and racial information on the boroughs.

On the contrary with what we just saw, if you look at death rates in Staten Island from 2012 to 2017, you'll notice that they outnumber those in the Bronx. Staten Island has the lowest percentage of poverty, the greatest average median income and the lowest number of Black and Hispanic residents. However, the death data we used doesn't have any information regarding people's races or financial statuses. Therefore, we don't know if the low-income, Black, and Hispanic residents of Staten Island are actually the ones dying from air pollution. As a result, we cannot establish a definitive link between death, poverty, and race.
